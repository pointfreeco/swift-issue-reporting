/// Invoke a function that has an issue that is expected to occur during its execution.
///
/// A generalized version of Swift Testing's [`withKnownIssue`][withKnownIssue] that works with this
/// library's [`reportIssue`](<doc:reportIssue(_:fileID:filePath:line:column:)>) instead of just
/// Swift Testing's tools.
///
/// At runtime it can be used to lower the log level of reported issues:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Emits a "purple" warning to Xcode and logs a fault-level message to console
/// reportIssue("Failed")
///
/// withExpectedIssue {
///   // Simply logs an info-level message
///   reportIssue("Failed")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// During test runs, the issue will be sent to Swift Testing's [`withKnownIssue`][withKnownIssue]
/// _or_ XCTest's [`XCTExpectFailure`][XCTExpectFailure] accordingly, which means you can use it to
/// drive custom assertion helpers that you want to work in both Swift Testing and XCTest.
///
/// Errors thrown from the function are automatically caught and reported as issues:
///
/// ```swift
/// withExpectedIssue {
///   // If this function throws an error, it will be caught and reported as an issue
///   try functionThatCanFail()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [withKnownIssue]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/withknownissue(_:isintermittent:fileid:filepath:line:column:_:)-30kgk
/// [XCTExpectFailure]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3727246-xctexpectfailure/
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - message: An optional message describing the expected issue.
///   - isIntermittent: Whether or not the expected issue occurs intermittently. If this argument is
///     `true` and the expected issue does not occur, no secondary issue is recorded.
///   - fileID: The source `#fileID` associated with the issue.
///   - filePath: The source `#filePath` associated with the issue.
///   - line: The source `#line` associated with the issue.
///   - column: The source `#column` associated with the issue.
///   - body: The function to invoke.
