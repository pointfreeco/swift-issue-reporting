# Creating testing tools

Learn how to build testing tools in your libraries using IssueReporting.

## Overview

It is common for libraries to provide a set of tools that help one test code that is using said
library. One can use this library to power those testing tools, and that comes with two big 
benefits:

* Your testing tools will simultaneously work in both XCTest and [swift-testing][testing-gh] with
no further work from you. The IssueReporting library smartly detects which testing framework is
being used, and correctly invokes either `XCTFail` or `Issue.record`.
* You can put your testing tools in the same library as the core tools, without the need of a
dedicated "test support" library. Typically testing tools need their own "test support" library
because you cannot invoke `XCTFail` (or `Issue.record`) from app targets. Our library dynamically
loads the symbols necessary to invoke those functions, and this makes it simpler for people to use
your library since they only have one single target to think about.

## Case studies

We have two main uses cases for IssueReporting in our libraries:

* In the [Composable Architecture][tca-gh] we provide a `TestStore` tool that
allows one to test their features. It allows you to send actions to the store and assert on how 
state changes, and further assert how effects feed data back into the system. These testing tools
need to invoke `XCTFail` (or `Issue.record`), but instead they can simply invoke
``reportIssue(_:fileID:filePath:line:column:)``. This will trigger a test failure in tests, all
without needing a dedicated "ComposableArchitectureTestSupport" library.

* In our [Dependencies][deps-gh] library, we like to trigger a test failure when dependencies are 
accessed in a test environment that have not been explicitly overridden. That helps to make sure
people do not accidentally access live dependencies in tests. However, that does mean we must
invoke `XCTFail` (or `Issue.record`) from within library to support this functionality, and 
generally speaking that is not possible. That is why we instead use `reportIssue` in Dependencies,
and then everything works just fine.

## Your own libraries

To build more robust testing tools for your libraries, or to be able to report issues from your 
library that are very customizable, simply depend on "IssueReporting" and use the 
``reportIssue(_:fileID:filePath:line:column:)`` tool.
