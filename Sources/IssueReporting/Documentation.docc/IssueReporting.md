# ``IssueReporting``

Report issues in your application and library code as Xcode runtime warnings, test failures, 
breakpoints, assertions, and more.

## Overview

This library provides robust tools for reporting issues in your application with a varying degree
of granularity and severity. In its most basic for you can use the unified 
[`reportIssue`](<doc:reportIssue(_:fileID:filePath:line:column:)>) function anywhere in your
application to flag an issue with your code, such as a code path that you think should never be
executed:

```swift
guard let lastItem = items.last
else {
  reportIssue("'items' should never be empty.")
  return 
}
â€¦
```

By default, `reportIssue` will trigger a purple runtime warning when running in the simulator or
device, and in tests it will trigger a test failure. This gives you an unobtrusive way to see
issues while running your app, while also catching the issues in tests with explicit test failures.

The `reportIssue` tool can also be customized to allow for other ways of reporting issues beyond
runtime warnings and test failures. It can also be configured to trigger a breakpoint if you want to
do some debugging when an issue is reported, or a precondition or fatal error, or you can create
your own custom issue reporter to send issues to OSLog or an external server.
